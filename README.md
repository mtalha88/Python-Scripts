# Python-Scripts-adds-numbering-to-images

# Problem:
There is a folder with N images in this format:
im_0001.jpg
im_0002.jpg
...
im_0NNN.jpg

if you need a python script that adds, on the image, in the top-left corner a text with the number of the image.
(it will create the new images under some "output" folder, with same original name)

for example, for im_0038.jpg, python script with add the text "0038" in the top-left corder and save the new image in:
/output/im_0038.jpg

# Solution:
--First Install Pillow with pip (pip install pillow), 

--Place the images in input folder, and Run the script..
